CENG 522 Advanced Object Oriented Programming

First commit from Mac

I got error from Atom Github Clone:
  error code 128. Unable to clone etc. etc.

Then I clone from bash and clone worked correctly. I follow the instructions at https://www.jcchouinard.com/clone-github-repository-on-windows/. It worked at mac as well.

I simply changed directory to /Users/emre/github at bash and run the following command:
git clone https://github.com/etileyli/AdvancedOOP.git

Note: If no login screen shows up at Atom after reopening, Open Keychain Access at Mac and delete Atom related github passwords. Then reopen Atom and login button at Atom Github tab should show up.
